Pages I want to have:

- An intro page - maybe not separate from the page where the user puts their name in??

- A page where the user can input their name (stretch goals: save user details and allow a previous user 
to log in, user some kind of smart shit to save their preferences and generate recipes they might especially like)

- A page where the user can input what's in their fridge/pantry (both individual ingredients and quantity)

- A page where the mulch recipe generator generates their recipe




To-Do List:

- Write text to appear on each page & draw wireframes
- Get basic components set up
- Get backend set up - database etc. Decide how recipe generator is going to work.
- Use Bulma to style pages





Things I want to do:

- Use Bulma for styling

- Use React on the frontend and Express on the backend



First things first: write the text that will appear on each page:

- All pages:
